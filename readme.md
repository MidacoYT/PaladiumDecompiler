# Procyon Advanced GUI  
A powerful Java-based decompiler GUI initially created to understand and decompile the **Palamod** (Minecraft mod from the Paladium server).  
It has evolved into an advanced tool with class renaming, AI-assisted analysis, tree navigation, tabbed code editors, and more.

This project was originally created to help decompile and understand a highly obfuscated **Minecraft Paladium mod (Palamod)**.  
Over time, it became a full decompiler environment.
